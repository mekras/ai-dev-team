Documentation principles
¶
Software development benefits from
philosophies
and
principles
such as
DRY
,
KISS
,
code reuse
, and more. Developers use these commonly understood
standards to produce high-quality code.
These principles also apply to software
documentation
to foster clean and intuitive
content that delights and empowers readers with
easy-to-find information.
General documentation principles
¶
All documentation should be…
Precursory
Participatory
Precursory
¶
Begin documenting before you begin developing.
Before coding, write requirements and specifications that serve as
the first draft of documentation. These texts need a bit
of cleanup before publishing, but by front-loading the documentation,
you lay a clear path forward. Early documentation also helps facilitate
peer feedback and group decisions to guide your work. This model is the
sentiment behind
documentation driven design
.
Participatory
¶
In the documentation process, include everyone from developers to end
users.
Integrate documentation into the standard workflow of developers, and
reduce silos that solicit documentation from only a subset of
the software’s contributors. Developers and engineers are the people
with the best access to in-demand information, and getting them to
document it will help foster a
culture
of documentation.
Documentation
readers
(i.e., users) should also have clear avenues
towards involvement in documentation. A good first step is to give
readers the ability to offer feedback through comments or
suggestions. Allowing readers to edit documentation directly (e.g., in a
wiki) can also be effective but must be weighed against the need and
capacity for editorial oversight.

everyone
to become a
documentarian

Principles for great content
¶
“Content” is the conceptual information within documentation.
Content
should be…
ARID
Skimmable
Exemplary
Consistent
Current
ARID
¶
Accept (some) Repetition In Documentation.
If you want to write good code,
Don’t Repeat Yourself
. But
if you adhere strictly to this DRY principle when writing documentation,
you won’t get far.
Some
amount of business logic described by
your code must be described
again
in your documentation.
In an ideal world, an automated system would generate documentation from
the software’s source code,
and
the system would be smart enough to
generate
good
documentation without any additional input.
Unfortunately, today, the best documentation is hand-written, which means that just by writing
any
documentation, you are repeating yourself. Sure,
documentation generators
exist and are useful, but it’s important to acknowledge that they still
require input from humans to function.
The pursuit of
minimizing
repetition remains valiant! ARID does not mean
WET
, hence the word choice. It means: try to keep things
as DRY as possible
but also recognize that you’ll inevitably need some amount of “moisture”
to produce documentation.
Cultivating an awareness of this inconvenient truth will hopefully be a
helpful step toward reminding developers that a need often exists to
update documentation along with code.
Skimmable
¶
Structure content to help readers identify and skip over concepts which
they already understand or are not relevant to their immediate
questions.
Burying concepts in prose and verbiage demands more time from readers
seeking answers to specific questions. Save your readers’ time by
writing like a newspaper instead of a novel.
Specifically:
Headings — should be descriptive and concise.
Hyperlinks — should surround words that describe the link itself
(and never phrases like “click here” or “this page”).
Paragraphs and list items — should begin with identifiable concepts
as early as possible.
Exemplary
¶
Include (some) examples and tutorials in content.
Many readers look first towards examples for quick answers, so including
them will help save these people time. Try to write examples for the
most common use cases, but not for everything. Too many examples can
make the documentation less
skimmable
. Also, consider
separating examples and tutorials from more dense reference information
to further help readers skim.
Consistent
¶
Use consistent language and formatting in content.
The more content editors you have, the more important a
style guide
becomes in facilitating consistency. Consistency also helps make documentation
skimmable
and
beautiful
.
Current
¶
Consider incorrect documentation to be worse than missing
documentation.
When software changes faster than its documentation, the users suffer.
Keep it up to date.
Make every effort to write content that is version-agnostic and thus in
less need of maintenance. For example, generalize version numbers of
software when they occur in tutorials (such as extracting a source code
tarball with the version number in the file name).
Some users will remain on older versions of your
software, and thus require older versions of your documentation. Proper
documentation platforms will accommodate such needs gracefully.
Principles for content sources
¶
A “source” refers to a system used to store and edit content.
Examples of sources include: text files written using
reStructuredText or Markdown, HTML content in a CMS database, help
text stored within strings in application code, code comments to be
assembled later into formalized documentation, and others too.
All
sources
should be…
Nearby
Unique
Nearby
¶
Store sources as close as possible to the code which they document.
Give developers systems that allow them to easily make documentation
changes along with their code changes. One way is to store documentation
content in comment blocks within application source code. Another is to
store it in separate text files but within the same repository as the
application’s source code. Either way, the goal is to merge (as much as
possible) the workflows for development and documentation.
Unique
¶
Eliminate content overlap between separate sources.
Storing content in different sources is okay, as long as the scope of
each source is clearly defined and disjoint with other sources. The goal
here is to prevent any parallel maintenance (or worse —
lack
of
maintenance) of the same information across multiple sources.
Principles for publications
¶
A “publication” refers to a single, cohesive tool that readers use to consume
documentation.
It may be static or interactive — digital or paper. Multiple
publications may be created from a single source (such as web and PDF
versions of the same manual). Although rarer, multiple sources may
be used to create a single publication. More examples of
publications include: API reference, man page, command line
--help
output, in-application help tips, online tutorials,
internal engineering manuals, and others too.
Each
publication
should be…
Discoverable
Addressable
Cumulative
Complete
Beautiful
Discoverable
¶
Funnel users intuitively towards publications through all likely
pathways.
Try to identify everywhere the user might go looking for documentation,
and in all of those places, insert helpful pointers for them to find it.
Documentation need not
exist
in all of these places, just pointers to
it.
If a user manual is published in the woods, and no one is around to read
it, does it exist?
Discoverability
says “no”.
Addressable
¶
Provide addresses to readers that link directly to content at a
granular level.
The ability to reference
specific
sections deep within a body of
documentation facilitates productive communication about the
documentation, even with one’s self. These addresses can take the form
of URLs, page numbers, or other forms depending on the publication
medium. Readers may wish to bookmark certain sections, share them with
other users, or provide feedback to the authors. The more granular this
ability, and the easier it is to access, the better.
Cumulative
¶
Content should be ordered to cover prerequisite concepts first.
Can a reader follow your entire body of documentation, linearly, from
start to finish without getting confused? If so, the documentation is
perfectly “cumulative”, which is great, but not always possible. It’s
something to strive for, especially in tutorials and examples. If you
have separated your tutorials and examples from the reference
documentation, then put the tutorials and examples first. Then, content
within the reference information section may be ordered alphabetically
or topically without regard to prerequisite needs.
The goal of cumulative ordering is not to encourage readers to consume
your documentation linearly — rather it is to help them narrow their
search for information when filling in gaps in their knowledge. If a
reader arrives with
some
knowledge of the software and begins reading
the documentation at the 25% mark, they are likely to “rewind” when
confused.
Complete
¶
Within each publication, cover concepts in full, or not at all.
Picture some documentation of software like a map of a neighborhood. If
the map displays roads, readers will expect it to display
all
roads
(which exist and are of the same
type
being displayed). Perhaps the
map does not display
railroads
, for example. Thus, a reader
approaching the map to look for railroads will find zero and then seek a
different map — but the map is still “complete”, even with this
shortcoming. “Complete” does not mean that the map must describe
all
characteristics of the land. It means simply that, for the
characteristics it chooses to describe, it should describe
all
of
them. A map that displays fifty out of one hundred fire hydrants in a
neighborhood is
worse
than a map that displays none.
As a good example,
iconv
is a command line tool for working with
character encodings. Its
man page
covers
all
of its available options but
none
of the possible character encodings
accepted as values to these options. Instead, the man page instructs the
user to run
iconv
-l
to produce a list of character encodings. In
this example, the man page and the list are separate publications, both
of which are complete, which is good!
Publishing partially completed documentation must be done cautiously. To
avoid misleading readers, make every effort to clearly state, up front,
that a particular concept is only covered partially.
Beautiful
¶
Visual style should be intentional and aesthetically pleasing.
Aesthetics don’t matter to everyone — but (consciously or not) some
readers will struggle to find comfort in documentation that lacks
attention to visual style. Even in text-only documentation such as
--help
output, visual style is still present in the form of spacing
and capitalization. If visual style is not important to you personally,
then consider soliciting stylistic improvements from others for whom it
is.
Principles for the body of publications
¶
A “body” refers to the collection of all the publications within a software
project and any of its sub-projects
A documentation
body
should be…
Comprehensive
Comprehensive
¶
Ensure that together, all the publications in the body of documentation
can answer all questions the user is likely to have.
We can never create enough documentation to satisfy
all
questions,
however obscure, that might arise from users — but satisfying the
likely
questions is certainly attainable and thus should be the goal
of a body of documentation. “Likely” is admittedly a blurry term, but
it’s also relative, which means that a body of documentation which
answers very unlikely questions while failing to answer likely ones is
somewhat out of balance.
Answering some questions may require the user to read multiple
publications, which is okay.
